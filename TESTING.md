## Logging Time / Date to Console

- Added capability to log date / time stamp(s) to the developer console.

- Removing variable e which logs date stamp as time in milliseconds to console.
- Why?: using methods to extract hours minutes and seconds from Date object instead.

- Removing duplicate string log to console for click event.
